Describe the key concepts of service relationships:
    a) Service offering:
         A service offering is a description of one or more services designed to meet the needs of a target consumer group.
            It may include:
                Goods (e.g., hardware, licenses)
                Access to resources (e.g., cloud platforms, apps)
                Service actions (e.g., support, maintenance)

    b) Service relationship management
        is the joint activities performed by a service provider and a service consumer to ensure continual value co-creation.
            It includes:
                Service provision
                Service consumption
                Key idea:
                Value is co-created, not delivered one-way.
                
                👉 Example:
                Regular reviews, feedback sessions, SLAs, and improvement discussions between IT and the business.

    c) Service provision:
        Service provision refers to the activities performed by the service provider to deliver services.
            This includes:
                Managing provider resources
                Ensuring service accessibility
                Fulfilling agreed service actions
                Managing service levels and improvements

                👉 Example:
                IT maintaining servers, monitoring uptime, applying patches, and responding to incidents.

    d) Service consumption
        Service consumption refers to the activities performed by the service consumer when using a service.
            This includes:
                Using the service
                Managing consumer resources
                Requesting service actions
                Participating in value realization

                👉 Example:
                Employees using email, submitting support tickets, following security policies.
