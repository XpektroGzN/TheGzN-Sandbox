The 7 ITIL Guiding Principles
1️⃣ Focus on Value

Everything you do should create value for customers, users, and the organization

Value can mean outcomes, cost savings, experience, or risk reduction

Always ask: “Who benefits from this, and how?”

2️⃣ Start Where You Are

Don’t throw away what already works

Assess existing services, processes, tools, and data before making changes

Use current capabilities as the foundation for improvement

3️⃣ Progress Iteratively with Feedback

Work in small, manageable steps

Gather feedback early and often

Reduces risk and helps adapt quickly to change

4️⃣ Collaborate and Promote Visibility

Break down silos between teams

Share information openly

Make work, priorities, and progress visible to everyone involved

5️⃣ Think and Work Holistically

Services are systems of people, processes, partners, and technology

Optimizing one part while ignoring others can cause failures elsewhere

Always look at the end-to-end service

6️⃣ Keep It Simple and Practical

Use the minimum number of steps needed to achieve the outcome

Avoid unnecessary complexity, documentation, and approvals

Simplicity improves speed and reliability

7️⃣ Optimize and Automate

First, optimize the process

Then automate where it makes sense

Automation should support well-designed workflows—not fix broken ones
