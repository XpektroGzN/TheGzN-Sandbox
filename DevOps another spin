⚔️ Want a more unique spin?

If you want, I can also explain DevOps “as a Jedi path,” a samurai code, an RPG skill tree, or a mentor-style guide. Just tell me the style you prefer.

Would you like:

✨ A visual map?
📘 A step-by-step beginner plan?
🔥 A mythic/epic storytelling version (“The Way of DevOps”)?


Another Spin for ITIL Guiding Principles inspired by ESO

🎮 ESO / Guild Leadership Memory Hook

If SVS were a guild:

Guiding Principles = Guild values & rules

Governance = Guild Master & officers

Service Value Chain = Events → Execution → Rewards

Practices = Tools, roles, routines

Continual Improvement = Learning from wipes
