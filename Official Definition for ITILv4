Describe the key concepts of creating value with services:
a) Cost :is the amount of money spent on activities or resources.

  Costs exist for both the service provider and the service consumer
  
  Consumers want value at an acceptable cost
  
  Providers aim to optimize costs while delivering value
  
  👉 Example: License fees, staff salaries, infrastructure, cloud subscription

b) Value: is the perceived benefit, usefulness, and importance of something.
    - Value is subjective
    - Defined by the service consumer, not the provider
    - Value = achieving desired outcomes without managing costs and risks.

   Value creation often involves multiple organizations working together
   👉 If a service works perfectly but doesn’t help the customer achieve their goal, it has low value


c) Organization:
   - An organization is a person or group of people with responsibilities, authorities, and relationships to achieve objectives.
     Can be a company, government body, non-profit, or internal department
     Organizations can be service providers, consumers, or both

d) Outcome:
   An outcome is a result for a stakeholder enabled by one or more outputs.
   Focused on what the customer wants to achieve
   Outcomes are where value is realized
   Customers care about outcomes, not outputs
  👉 Example:
   Outcome = Employees can collaborate remotely effectively

e) Output:
  An output is a tangible or intangible deliverable of an activity.
  Outputs enable outcomes
  Outputs alone do not guarantee value
  👉 Example:
   Output = A collaboration tool installed and configured.

f) Risk:
   Risk is a possible event that could cause harm or loss or make it more difficult to achieve objectives.
   Includes cost-related risks and outcome-related risks
   Services help consumers reduce or manage risk
   Risk is shared between provider and consumer
   👉 Example: Security breaches, downtime, compliance failures


g) Utility:
   Utility is the functionality offered by a service to meet a particular need.
   Often described as “what the service does.”
   Answers the question: Is the service fit for purpose?
   Focuses on features and functionality
   👉 Example: A payroll system can calculate salaries correctly

h) Warranty:Is the assurance that a service will meet agreed requirements.
   Often described as “how the service is delivered.”
   Answers the question: Is the service fit for use?
   Covers availability, capacity, continuity, and security
  👉 Example: Payroll system is available on payday, secure, and fast enough
